## Game Story

In a lush green field under a clear blue sky, there lives a happy guinea pig family.  
Their days are filled with joy and an abundance of hay to munch on.  
One day, three aliens open a black hole in the sky, threatening to take over the land and the piggies' home.

Determined to defend their turf, the guinea pig family sends their most poop-productive soldier into battle.  
Using their natural talent, this brave soldier flings poop at the aliens. The more poop that hits them, the more "wheekified" the aliens become‚Äîtransforming into piggy friends instead of invaders.

But beware! The aliens drop hay bales‚Äîdelicious distractions that could cause the soldier to lose focus.  
Take cover under the blue cloud barrier when needed‚Äîbut remember, it absorbs _everything_, poop and hay alike!
